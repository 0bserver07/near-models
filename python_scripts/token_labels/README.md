# Near DBT Project - Python Scripts

## Setup

1. Install Python 3 in your machine https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2. Open your terminal/command prompt and go to this directory.

3. Run the following command:

> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the Python script by typing:

> `python <script name here>.py`

(e.g. `python token_labels_retriever.py`)

## Troubleshooting

1. Check if you're in the right directory
2. If the commands are not recognized, you need to add Python in your environment variables
