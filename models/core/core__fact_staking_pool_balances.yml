    description: |-
      Staking pool balances as extracted from receipt logs when an individual makes a staking action.
      To calculate balance at a point in time, isolate a single record for each pool. This table is transactional-based, so balances are updated with every staking event by users.
      Note - the amount in balance is decimal adjusted by 10^24.
